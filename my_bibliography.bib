abstract = {Special events are typically regarded as major generators of economic activity and jobs. Despite its continued use in event assessment, Input-Output (I-O) analysis has been rejected in other areas of economic impact evaluation in favor of more rigorous evaluation techniques that recognize resource constraints in the economy and interindustry effects of demand shocks. This article discusses traditional and alternative perspectives on event assessment and the assumptions on which each approach are based. Illustrative results are then provided from a study that contrasted the economic impacts from a selected event analyzed by use of a traditional I-O approach, with estimates provided through the use of a more comprehensive computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Issues involved in the wider use of CGE models for event assessment are discussed together with the need for further development in event evaluation techniques.},

The Pacific Northwest, with its historic abundance of low-cost hydropower and dependence on public power, will experience deregulation as conditioned by this legacy. This analysis focuses on the economic impacts of deregulation on the State of Washington. A 31-sector computable general equilibrium model is used to evaluate the impacts on Washington's economy. In a most likely scenario, electricity exports expand to high-priced regions. The impact on the state economy is a reduction in gross state product as a result of higher electricity prices.

abstract = {Quantitative models for climate policy modeling differ in the production structure used and in the sizes of the elasticities of substitution. The empirical foundation for both is generally lacking. This paper estimates the parameters of 2-level CES production functions with capital, labour and energy as inputs, and is the first to systematically compare all nesting structures. Using industry-level data from 12 OECD countries, we find that the nesting structure where capital and labour are combined first, fits the data best, but for most countries and industries we cannot reject that all three inputs can be put into one single nest. These two nesting structures are used by most climate models. However, while several climate policy models use a Cobb-Douglas function for (part of the) production function, we reject elasticities equal to one, in favour of considerably smaller values. Finally we find evidence for factor-specific technological change. With lower elasticities and with factor-specific technological change, some climate policy models may find a bigger effect of endogenous technological change on mitigating the costs of climate policy. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Substituting carbon taxes for labour taxes can reduce GHG emissions and enhance welfare by improving the efficiency of the tax system - a strong double dividend. The analyses confirm, when capital is not internationally mobile, that a double dividend is likely to occur under (i) a high elasticity of labour supply, (ii) high elasticities of substitution between labour and the capital-energy aggregate, (iii) low elasticities of substitution between capital and energy. It is the tax-shifting effect between capital and labour that is crucial. In contrast, welfare losses resulting from the environmental tax reform may be substantial if capital is internationally mobile. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V..},

As recommended by theory, top marginal income tax rates have declined, marginal income tax schedules have flattened, redistribution has risen with income inequality, and commodity taxes are more uniform and are typically assessed on final goods. However, trends in capital taxation are mixed, and capital income tax rates remain well above the zero level recommended by theory. Moreover, some of theory's more subtle prescriptions, such as taxes that involve personal characteristics, asset-testing, and history-dependence, remain rare in practice.

abstract = {Abstract Facing with the increasing contradiction of economic growth, energy scarcity and environmental deterioration, energy conservation and emissions abatement have been ambitious targets for the Chinese government. Improving energy efficiency through technological advancement is a primary measure to achieve these targets. However, the existence of energy rebound effects may completely or partially offset energy savings associated with technological advancement. This paper adopted a modified input-output model to estimate the economy-wide energy rebound effects across China's economic sectors with the consideration of energy subsidies. The empirical results show that the aggregate rebound effect of China is about 1.9{\%} in 2007–2010, thus technological advancement significantly restrains energy consumption increasing. Removing energy subsidies will cause the aggregate rebound effect declines to 1.53{\%}. Specifically, removing subsidies for coal and nature gas can reduce the rebound effects signifcantly, while removing the subsidies for oil products has a small impact on rebound effect. The existence of rebound effects implies that technological advancement should be cooperated with energy price reform so as to achieve the energy saving target. In addition, the government should consider the diversity of economic sectors and energy types when design the reform schedule.},

Pre-existing taxes imply significantly higher abatement costs for every instrument considered, but the cost-impact of such taxes differs sharply across instruments. Prior taxes can eliminate the cost-advantage of market-based instruments (emissions taxes and permits) over technology mandates or performance standards, particularly if the former policies fail to generate revenues and use the revenues to finance cuts in the prior distortionary taxes. The cost differences between instruments are highly sensitive to the extent of pollution abatement: for most policies, abatement costs converge to the same value as pollution abatement approaches 100 percent.},

Job losses in the coal and natural gas industry are modeled to project net employment impacts. Benefits and drawbacks of the methodology are assessed and the resulting model is used for job projections under various renewable portfolio standards (RPS), EE, and low carbon energy scenarios We find that all non-fossil fuel technologies (renewable energy, EE, low carbon) create more jobs per unit energy than coal and natural gas. Aggressive EE measures combined with a 30{\%} RPS target in 2030 can generate over 4 million full-time-equivalent job-years by 2030 while increasing nuclear power to 25{\%} and CCS to 10{\%} of overall generation in 2030 can yield an additional 500,000 job-years. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

These investments will result in an average annual increase of the national product by €9.4 billion, creating simultaneously 108,000 full-time equivalent jobs for the entire period under consideration.

The results show that the peripheral member countries have been suffering from increasingly overvalued exchange rates since the mid-2000s, as their real appreciation has not stemmed from improving fundamentals in terms of productivity or external position. In addition, currency misalignments have been increased on average for all euro area countries since the monetary union, while becoming more persistent.

abstract = {If there were an Economist's Creed, it would surely contain the affirmations "I understand the Principle of Comparative Advantage" and "I advocate Free Trade." For one hundred seventy years, the appreciation that international trade benefits a country whether it is "fair" or not has been one of the touchstones of professionalism in economics. Comparative advantage is not just an idea both simple and profound; it is an idea that conflicts directly with both stubborn popular prejudices and powerful interests. This combination makes the defense of free trade as close to a sacred tenet as any idea in economics. Yet the case for free trade is currently more in doubt than at any time since the 1817 publication of Ricardo's Principles of Political Economy. This is not because of the political pressures for protection, which have triumphed in the past without shaking the intellectual foundations of comparative advantage theory. Rather, it is because of the changes that have recently taken place in the theory of international trade itself. While new developments in international trade theory may not yet be familiar to the profession at large, they have been substantial and radical. In the last ten years the traditional constant returns, perfect competition models of international trade have been supplemented and to some extent supplanted by a new breed of models that emphasizes increasing returns and imperfect competition. These new models call into doubt the extent to which actual trade can be explained by comparative advantage; they also open the possibility that government intervention in trade via import restrictions, export subsidies, and so on may under some circumstances be in the national interest after all. To preview this paper's conclusion: free trade is not passe, but it is an idea that has irretrievably lost its innocence. Its status has shifted from optimum to reasonable rule of thumb. There is still a case for free trade as a good policy, and as a useful target in the practical world of politics, but it can never again be asserted as the policy that economic theory tells us is always right.},

abstract = {Abstract In order to enhance energy efficiency as a pillar of transition to a green energy economy it is important to understand whether and under which conditions energy efficiency programs could have positive economic and social impacts. There are a growing number of studies on macroeconomic impacts of energy efficiency programs for various countries and regions. However, in Switzerland only few evaluations have been performed. The present study evaluates the impacts on $\backslash${\{}GDP$\backslash${\}} and employment of Geneva's energy efficiency program portfolio {\'{e}}co21 which is operated by the local utility. Two programs aiming for electricity savings in the residential sector are analyzed: Eco-sociales targets social housing and Communs d'immeubles focuses on common spaces in buildings. An input–output model is developed, based on the Swiss input–output table, program administrator data, Swiss, and European statistics. Both impacts of initial expenditure and energy cost savings are evaluated. We estimate and compare the impacts of the two programs and discuss factors that cause differences. Our results show that energy efficiency programs can have positive impacts on $\backslash${\{}GDP$\backslash${\}} and employment. According to our estimates, each Swiss Franc (CHF) spent within the energy efficiency program creates approximately 0.2 $\backslash${\{}CHF$\backslash${\}} of additional $\backslash${\{}GDP$\backslash${\}} compared to the reference case scenario. Net impacts on employment are approximately 0.7 and 1.6 additional jobs in full-time equivalent for 1 million $\backslash${\{}CHF$\backslash${\}} of expenditure driven by Eco-sociales and Communs d'immeubles respectively, compared to the reference case scenario. However, the results strongly depend on several hypotheses, including the impact of energy savings on the domestic energy sector, the import share in consumed goods and services, electricity prices, lifetimes of energy efficiency measures, and the assumed expenditure patterns. Based on our results we provide recommendations on measures for improving the macroeconomic impacts of energy efficiency programs: a preference for expenditure on local goods and services, maximization of cost effectiveness of energy efficiency programs, and their integration with energy supply planning. We conclude that energy efficiency programs and policies should be well coordinated with other policies in practice, the roles of stakeholders should be clearly defined, and all stakeholders should be provided with necessary instruments and powers.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the economic costs of rebalancing current account positions in the Euro area by means of internal devaluation. Internal devaluation relies on wage suppression in the deficit countries. Based on an old Keynesian model we estimate a current account equation, a wage-Phillips curve and an Okun's Law equation. All estimations are carried out for a panel of twelve Euro area members. From the estimation results we calculate the output costs of reducing current account deficits. Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain (GIIPS) had, on average, current account deficits of 8.4{\%} of GDP in 2007. To eliminate these current account deficits, a reduction of GPD by some 47{\%} would be necessary. Trade imbalances can be resolved in two ways: deflationary adjustment in the deficit countries or inflationary adjustment in the surplus countries. The economic costs of deflationary adjustment to those countries are equivalent to the output loss of the Great Depression. An adjustment of the surplus countries would increase growth and it would come with higher inflation, but it would allow rebalancing without a Great Depression in parts of Europe. 1.},

Our analytical model shows that initial labor market rigidities in theory provide some scope for such a double dividend. However, the practical outcome of renewable energy promotion might be sobering. Our computable general equilibrium analysis of subsidized electricity production from renewable energy sources (RES-E) in Germany suggests that the prospects for employment and welfare gains are quite limited and hinge crucially on the level of the subsidy rate and the financing mechanism. If RES-E subsidies are financed by labor taxes, welfare and employment effects are strictly negative for a broad range of subsidy rates. The use of an electricity tax to fund RES-E subsidies generates minor benefits for small subsidy rates but these benefits quickly turn into significant losses as the subsidy rate exceeds some threshold value. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The threat of climate change and other risks for ecosystems and human health require a transition of the energy system from fossil fuels towards renewable energies and higher efficiency. The European geographical periphery, and specifically Southern Europe, has considerable potential for renewable energies. At the same time it is also stricken by high levels of public debt and unemployment, and struggles with austerity policies as consequences of the Eurozone crisis. Modeling studies find a broad optimum when searching for a cost-optimal deployment of renewable energy installations. This allows for the consideration of additional policy objectives. Simultaneously, economists argue for an increase in public expenditure to compensate for the slump in private investments and to provide economic stimulus. This paper combines these two perspectives. We assess the potential for renewable energies in the European periphery, and highlight relevant costs and barriers for a large-scale transition to a renewable energy system. We find that a European energy transition with a high-level of renewable energy installations in the periphery could act as an economic stimulus, decrease trade deficits, and possibly have positive employment effects. Our analysis also suggests that country-specific conditions and policy frameworks require member state policies to play a leading role in fostering an energy transition. This notwithstanding, a stronger European-wide coordination of regulatory frameworks and supportive funding schemes would leverage country-specific action. Renewed solidarity could be the most valuable outcome of a commonly designed and implemented European energy transition.},

@techreport{OECD/IEA2016,
abstract = {The International Energy Agency (IEA), an autonomous agency, was established in November 1974. Its primary mandate was – and is – two-fold: to promote energy security amongst its member countries through collective response to physical disruptions in oil supply, and provide authoritative research and analysis on ways to ensure reliable, affordable and clean energy for its 29 member countries and beyond. The IEA carries out a comprehensive programme of energy co-operation among its member countries, each of which is obliged to hold oil stocks equivalent to 90 days of its net imports. The Agency's aims include the following objectives: n Secure member countries' access to reliable and ample supplies of all forms of energy; in particular, through maintaining effective emergency response capabilities in case of oil supply disruptions. n Promote sustainable energy policies that spur economic growth and environmental protection in a global context – particularly in terms of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions that contribute to climate change. n Improve transparency of international markets through collection and analysis of energy data. n Support global collaboration on energy technology to secure future energy supplies and mitigate their environmental impact, including through improved energy efficiency and development and deployment of low-carbon technologies. n Find solutions to global energy challenges through engagement and dialogue with non-member countries, industry, international organisations and other stakeholders. The Paris Agreement on climate change, which entered into force in November 2016, is at its heart an agreement about energy. Transformative change in the energy sector, the source of at least two-thirds of greenhouse-gas emissions, is essential to reach the objectives of the Agreement. The changes already underway in the energy sector, demonstrating the promise and potential of low-carbon energy, in turn lend credibility to meaningful action on climate change. Growth in energy-related CO 2 emissions stalled completely in 2015. This was mainly due to a 1.8{\%} improvement in the energy intensity of the global economy, a trend bolstered by gains in energy efficiency, as well as the expanded use of cleaner energy sources worldwide, mostly renewables. An increasing slice of the roughly {\$}1.8 trillion of investment each year in the energy sector has been attracted to clean energy, at a time when investment in upstream oil and gas has fallen sharply. The value of fossil-fuel consumption subsidies dropped in 2015 to {\$}325 billion, from almost {\$}500 billion the previous year, reflecting lower fossil-fuel prices but also a subsidy reform process that has gathered momentum in several countries. The renewables-led transformation of the power sector has given focus to a new debate over power market design and electricity security, while traditional energy security concerns have not gone away. Adding in issues of energy access, affordability, climate change and energy-related air pollution, as well as problems with public acceptance for different types of energy projects, there are many trade-offs, co-benefits and competing priorities that need to be untangled across the energy sector. This is the task that the World Energy Outlook (WEO) takes up in different scenarios and case studies, with the additional opportunity in 2016 to provide the first comprehensive examination of the new era opened up by the Paris Agreement. All the Paris climate pledges, covering some 190 countries, have been examined in detail and incorporated into our main scenario. More stringent decarbonisation options examined in WEO-2016 include not only the 450 Scenario (consistent with a 50{\%} chance of limiting global warming to 2 °C) but also a first examination of pathways that could limit warming further.},

abstract = {Using a three-sector general equilibrium model, the impact of renewable electricity support policies on the rate of equilibrium unemployment is analyzed. In a simple two-factor version of the model, the paper shows analytically that renewable electricity support policies lead to an increase in the rate of unemployment. A numerical analysis is conducted with an expanded three-factor model. In this version, most scenarios analyzed also lead to an increase in equilibrium unemployment. However, the paper identifies conditions in which renewable energy support policies can decrease the rate of equilibrium unemployment. In particular, when the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor is low, when capital is not mobile internationally, and when the labor intensity of renewable generation is high relative to conventional generation, renewable electricity support policies may reduce the rate of equilibrium unemployment. The model is parameterized to represent the US economy, such that the magnitudes of quantities can be observed. Although there is some variation in the results depending on parameters, the findings suggest in general that reducing electricity sector emissions by 10{\%} through renewable electricity support policies is likely to increase the equilibrium unemployment rate by about 0.1-0.3 percentage points. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A variety of models have been applied to assess the economic losses of disasters, of which the most common ones are input–output (IO) and computable general equilibrium (CGE) models. In addition, an increasing number of scholars have developed hybrid approaches: one that combines both or either of them in combination with noneconomic methods. While both IO and CGE models are widely used, they are mainly compared on theoretical grounds. Few studies have compared disaster impacts of different model types in a systematic way and for the same geographical area, using similar input data. Such a comparison is valuable from both a scientific and policy perspective as the magnitude and the spatial distribution of the estimated losses are born likely to vary with the chosen modelling approach (IO, CGE, or hybrid). Hence, regional disaster impact loss estimates resulting from a range of models facilitate better decisions and policy making. Therefore, this study analyses the economic consequences for a specific case study, using three regional disaster impact models: two hybrid IO models and a CGE model. The case study concerns two flood scenarios in the Po River basin in Italy. Modelling results indicate that the difference in estimated total (national) economic losses and the regional distribution of those losses may vary by up to a factor of 7 between the three models, depending on the type of recovery path. Total economic impact, comprising all Italian regions, is negative in all models though.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This paper uses a newly developed econometric general equilibrium model for the European Union as well as for each member country and presents simulation results up to the year 2010 of the effects of a European carbon tax the revenues from which are recycled to reduce employers' social security contributions. The results show that recycling carbon tax revenues may provide an ‘employment double dividend' only in the short run.},

@article{Frondel2010,
abstract = {The allure of an environmentally benign, abundant, and cost-effective energy source has led an increasing number of industrialized countries to back public financing of renewable energies. Germany's experience with renewable energy promotion is often cited as a model to be replicated elsewhere, being based on a combination of far-reaching energy and environmental laws that stretch back nearly two decades. This paper critically reviews the centerpiece of this effort, the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG), focusing on its costs and the associated implications for job creation and climate protection. We argue that German renewable energy policy, and in particular the adopted feed-in tariff scheme, has failed to harness the market incentives needed to ensure a viable and cost-effective introduction of renewable energies into the country's energy portfolio. To the contrary, the government's support mechanisms have in many respects subverted these incentives, resulting in massive expenditures that show little long-term promise for stimulating the economy, protecting the environment, or increasing energy security. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Recent developments have highlighted the urgent need for some euro-area Member States to restore their external balances and to improve their competitiveness. While nominal exchange rate adjustment is not an available tool for the correction of external imbalances in a currency union, alternative policies of 'internal devaluation' can mimic the expenditure-switching effects of 'external' exchange rate devaluation. (27) Internal devaluation policies aim to reduce domestic prices either by affecting relative export-import prices or by lowering domestic production costs and thereby yielding a real exchange rate depreciation. An example of such internal devaluation is a revenue-neutral shift from taxes on labour to taxes on consumption. By reducing the tax burden on exports and raising that on imports this policy can help to restore competitiveness. Likewise, public-sector wage moderation may achieve overall wage moderation by exerting downward pressure on wages in the private sector and thereby reduce firms' production costs and lead to a real exchange rate depreciation restoring competitiveness. This section analyses the potential effects of these policies based on simulations using a three-region version of the European Commission's QUEST model: (28) a small euro-area member country, the rest of the euro area, and the rest of the world. The model includes tradable and non-tradable sectors and trade in final goods and intermediate inputs. It also distinguishes between private-sector and public-sector employment. The policy measures analysed are: (i) a tax reform shifting government revenue from social security contributions towards consumption taxes and (ii) a public-sector wage reduction aiming at achieving overall labour cost moderation. The rest of the section discusses each scenario in more details.},

Against this background, RES-E support policies making widely use of technology differentiation in remuneration settings, e.g. across the EU, are frequently criticized from a theoretical point of view. However, in this paper we provide a systematic critique of the technology neutrality concept as a foundation for designing policy support schemes in the RES-E technology field. Specifically, the main objective of the paper is to scrutinize the arguments for technology-neutrality, and discuss three conceptual arguments for why technology-specific support schemes could in fact help minimize the societal costs of reaching future RES-E targets. We also briefly address different political economy concerns, which could constrain the choice of cost-effective policy support schemes, and that have to be taken into account for economic policy advice. For empirical illustration of the key arguments we refer to the case of German RES-E policy-making. The central conclusion from this paper is that technology-specific RES-E support schemes may generate significant economic benefits, particularly if technology markets work imperfectly and in second-best policy settings with additional non-internalized market failures.},

abstract = {Most studies of the optimal provision of public goods or the excess burden from taxation assume that individual utility is independent of other individuals' consumption. This paper investigates public good provision and excess burden in a model that allows for interdependence in consumption in the form of status (relative consumption) effects. In the presence of such effects, consumption and labor taxes no longer are pure distortionary taxes but have a corrective tax element that addresses an externality from consumption. As a result, the marginal excess burden of consumption taxes is lower than in the absence of status effects, and will be negative if the consumption tax rate is below the "Pigouvian" rate. Correspondingly, when consumption or labor tax rates are below the Pigouvian rate, the second-best level of public goods provision is above the first-best level, contrary to findings from models without status effects. For plausible functional forms and parameters relating to status effects, the marginal excess burden from existing U.S. labor taxes is substantially lower than in most prior studies, and is negative in some cases. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The recent sovereign debt crisis in the Eurozone, which still continues to grow, is presumed to be one of the most severe financial crisis in the world economy during the past decades. The crisis represents not only a real threat to the recovery of the Eurozone but also to the world economy. Indeed, one of the challenges many European countries are currently confronting with is a trade deficit, which stems from an overvalued Euro. Many empirical studies have shown that an overvalued Euro has led to a current account deficit in many European countries. The neighbor thy policy recently adopted by Japan and the manipulation of Renminbi by China to boost its economy has created more pressures on the Eurozone exports. In order to reverse this trend, adoption of real and financial sector reforms, including devaluation of Euro, seems inevitable. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the impact of devaluation of Euro on Eurozone exports using Keynesian approach, and implementing econometric models. The results of this study suggest that a trivial devaluation in Euro has statistically significant impact on the Eurozone exports, which could reverse the delayed recovery of many peripheral countries.

abstract = {Energy efficiency measures in buildings are essential for climate protection, but are not always recognized by the investor in common profitability calculations. To provide a quantitative scientific base for policymakers, the aim is to identify and quantify the impact of these measures on Germany's economy with a static open input-output model. Moreover, this investigation analyses how much the chosen base year affects the calculated macroeconomic impact, to obtain a clearer view of involved dynamics. The energy efficiency measures in buildings and their impact on energy demand and investments were simulated in the bottom-up building model INVERT/EE-Lab up to 2020. The methodological addition of this research is to identify and map the resulting impulses to the according macroeconomic sectors. Based on this stimulus a static input-output analysis is conducted using a range of base years. The results show that efficiency measures in buildings have a significant positive effect on macroeconomic key figures. The magnitude of the calculated impact depends on chosen base year data and varies for value added and employment. As a conclusion, the macroeconomic impact constitutes a co-benefit supporting the economic attractiveness of energy efficiency. However, studies based on a single base year dataset like many computable general equilibrium models may need to reflect the errors caused by that choice.},

abstract = {Renewable energy sources (RES) play a key role in the European Commission's 2030 Climate and Energy Framework, which aims for a low-carbon economy that increases the security of the EU's energy supplies and creates new opportunities for growth and jobs, among other benefits. We assess whether renewable energy deployment in Europe can provide this “triple dividend”, at which ambition levels of 2030 RES targets and what the role of the support policy scheme for electricity is. We apply two types of models: a detailed techno-economic sector model of the deployment of RES and two macroeconomic models. Our findings suggest that up to 2030 our triple-dividend hypothesis holds even under a declining role of Europe as technology provider for the rest of the world. Additional emission reductions of up to 1040 Mt CO2, as compared to a baseline scenario in 2030, are possible. Demand for fossil fuels can likewise be reduced due to the deployment of renewable energy sources by up to 150 Mtoe. More ambiguous is the order of magnitude of the effects on GDP and employment, which differs noticeably depending on the economic theory applied in the different models. Nevertheless, both models predict slightly higher GDP and employment in 2030 when implementing ambitious RES targets.},

@article{Patuelli2005,
abstract = {In this paper, we offer a meta-analytical synthesis of recent (simulation) studies on environmental tax reform (ETR). The studies considered here look at both environmental effects (e.g., reduction in CO2 emission) and economic effects (e.g., employment gains) consequent upon such a tax reform. The existing statistical results from the literature mainly suggest that the tax type, the recycling policy, and the economic model used in the simulations significantly influence the chance that a 'double dividend' effect can be obtained. These empirical results are, however, not entirely conclusive regarding the question of which combination of policies and models will lead to a higher double dividend. This issue is investigated in our study by a quantitative meta-analytic approach. Our meta-analytic statistical experiment demonstrates that the total effect of a tax-and-recycle policy has a significant influence on the economic variables (second dividend), when employment is used. It is also shown that different definitions of the double dividend contribute in determining the success of ETR, in particular since the effects on GDP are less clear than for employment. These findings should be taken into consideration when deploying an ETR in a policy context, in order to prevent a situation where ETR is rejected or accepted solely due to characteristics of one simulation study rather than through a wide set of results from different studies.},

abstract = {There have recently been a growing number of computable general equilibrium (CGE) analyses for developing economies. These analyses often employ so-called structuralist CGE models equipped with fixed wage rates and unemployment (or an unlimited supply of labour). However, the assumption of fixed prices can cause a problem: simulation results can be dependent on the choice of num{\'{e}}raire. This problem is numerically examined with a simple structuralist CGE model. By analysing numerical examples, it was found that simulation results with structuralist CGE models can crucially depend on the choice of num{\'{e}}raire. The simulation results are different qualitatively as well as quantitatively by cases. The results suggest that the num{\'{e}}raire must be chosen carefully and simulation results should be evaluated in light of the chosen num{\'{e}}raire when we assume fixed prices in CGE models.

The regional economic impact of biofuel production depends upon a number of interrelated factors: the specific biofuels feedstock and production technology employed; the sector's embeddedness in the rest of the economy, through its demand for local resources; and the extent to which new activity is created. These issues can be analysed using multisectoral economic models. Some studies use input–output (IO) and social accounting matrix (SAM) modelling frameworks, whilst a nascent computable general equilibrium (CGE) literature has begun to examine the regional impact of biofuel development.

In this paper, we study this question using a two-country (North-South) extension of Acemoglu et al. (2012) which introduces directed technical change into a general equilibrium model of climate change. We find that, first, the optimal policy necessarily requires global policy coordination, with the implementation of research subsidies and carbon taxes in both North and South. Second, under certain circumstances, appropriately chosen environmental regulations in the North alone can prevent the worst environmental disasters. In particular, such disasters can be prevented by a combination of carbon taxes and clean research subsidies under the restrictive conditions that (a) the two inputs are substitutable in both countries; (b) there is no international trade between the North and the South; and (c) the South imitates technologies invented in the North. Third, international trade between the North and the South typically makes it more difficult to prevent environmental disasters through unilateral policies in the North, because environmental regulation in the North may induce full specialization by the South in dirty input production, as imitation of clean technologies by the South then ceases to be profitable. Hence, given current circumstances, global policy coordination is highly desirable.},

@article{Krugman1987a,
abstract = {If there were an Economist's Creed, it would surely contain the affirmations "I understand the Principle of Comparative Advantage" and "I advocate Free Trade." For one hundred seventy years, the appreciation that international trade benefits a country whether it is "fair" or not has been one of the touchstones of professionalism in economics. Comparative advantage is not just an idea both simple and profound; it is an idea that conflicts directly with both stubborn popular prejudices and powerful interests. This combination makes the defense of free trade as close to a sacred tenet as any idea in economics. Yet the case for free trade is currently more in doubt than at any time since the 1817 publication of Ricardo's Principles of Political Economy. This is not because of the political pressures for protection, which have triumphed in the past without shaking the intellectual foundations of comparative advantage theory. Rather, it is because of the changes that have recently taken place in the theory of international trade itself. While new developments in international trade theory may not yet be familiar to the profession at large, they have been substantial and radical. In the last ten years the traditional constant returns, perfect competition models of international trade have been supplemented and to some extent supplanted by a new breed of models that emphasizes increasing returns and imperfect competition. These new models call into doubt the extent to which actual trade can be explained by comparative advantage; they also open the possibility that government intervention in trade via import restrictions, export subsidies, and so on may under some circumstances be in the national interest after all. To preview this paper's conclusion: free trade is not passe, but it is an idea that has irretrievably lost its innocence. Its status has shifted from optimum to reasonable rule of thumb. There is still a case for free trade as a good policy, and as a useful target in the practical world of politics, but it can never again be asserted as the policy that economic theory tells us is always right.},

abstract = {The need for diversity has been cited as a rationale for important recent investment decisions in the UK electricity supply sector. It is invoked as the principal argument for continuing major government intervention. Yet there exists no formal analytical basis for the concept. Why is diversity good? What is meant by 'diversification'? What is it that must be 'diversified'? What trade off should be struck between 'diversity' and other measures of performance? The resulting ambiguity causes confusion and is vulnerable to special pleading. Despite this, this paper argues that diversification offers a superior alternative to probabilistic approaches towards uncertainty and ignorance in electricity supply investments and proposes a formal analytical approach. A quantitative index of diversity is borrowed from information theory and used to derive a value for the government's implicit willingness to pay for diversity in the UK electricity supply mix. This is then applied in a pilot exercise to the problem of optimizing the diversity and financial performance of the supply portfolio. Although provisional, the results are relevant to the government's forthcoming Nuclear Review, particularly in assessing the relative levels of support for nuclear power and renewable energy. ?? 1994.},

Consistently with his results, I estimate elasticities of substitution that are not significantly different from one. I next show, however, that restricting the analysis to Hicks-neutral technological change necessarily biases the estimates of the elasticity towards one. When I modify the econometric specification to allow for biased technical change, I obtain significantly lower estimates of the elasticity of substitution. I conclude that the U.S. economy is not well described by a Cobb-Douglas aggregate production function. I present estimates based on both classical regression analysis and time series analysis. In the process, I deal with issues related to the nonsphericality of the disturbances, the endogeneity of the regressors, and the nonstationarity of the series involved in the estimation.},

abstract = {This article gives a detailed account of part of the modelling that was carried out for the assessment of the EU's proposed energy and climate targets for 2030. Using the macro-econometric simulation model, E3ME, and drawing on results from the PRIMES energy systems model, it shows that a 40{\%} reduction in GHG emissions (compared to 1990 levels) could lead to an increase in employment of up to 0.7 million jobs in Europe. Furthermore, if the same GHG reduction target was combined with targets for renewables and energy efficiency, the net increase in jobs could be as high as 1.2 million. Both results are in contrast to the standard findings from computable general equilibrium (CGE) models, reflecting the different underlying assumptions (e.g. labour supply) to the modelling approach. Additional sensitivity testing shows that the ways in which the energy efficiency and renewable measures are funded are important factors in determining overall economic impact.},

abstract = {In this paper we present an up-to-date literature review on employment opportunities associated with the deployment of renewable energy technology. We identified approximately 70 studies and data sources published over the past decade that report analysed or observed employment impacts of renewable energy growth. These publications cover many different countries and several technology options, and present widely varying results derived from distinct methodological approaches. Our first overall conclusion is that there is clear lack of authenticity of findings in this literature, since recursive referencing abounds and relatively few studies yield truly original research. When we omit non-authentic analyses, as well as those that aggregate results in a way that does not allow us to calculate ‘employment factors' (defined as the number of jobs or amount of work generated per unit of electricity production capacity), the total list of references is brought to 31 independent items. Of these, only 14 references provide separate estimates of the employment factors for the stages of manufacturing and installation, respectively, as opposed to employment factors for these two activities combined. A total of 23 items provide values for operation and maintenance employment factors. We observe significant uncertainties in quoted figures for job creation, both across and within publications.},

I document a large decline in the capital share and a large increase in the profit share in the U.S. non-financial corporate sector over the last 30 years. I show that the decline in the capital share is robust to many calculations of the required rate of return and is unlikely to be driven by unobserved capital. I interpret these results through the lens of a standard general equilibrium model, and I show that only an increase in markups can generate a simultaneous decline in the shares of both labor and capital. I provide reduced form empirical evidence that an increase in markups plays a significant role in the decline in the labor share. These results suggest that the decline in the shares of labor and capital are due to an increase in markups and call into question the conclusion that the decline in the labor share is an efficient outcome.},

abstract = {This paper extends the Mirrlees (1971) model of optimal income redistribution with optimal corrective taxes to internalize consumption externalities. Using general utility structures and exploring both linear and non-linear taxes, it is demonstrated that the optimal second-best tax on an externality-generating good should not be corrected for the marginal cost of public funds, since it equals one in the optimal tax system. In the optimum, distortions of income taxes are equal to marginal redistributional gains. If the government does not have access to a non-distortionary marginal source of finance, the marginal cost of public funds can be either larger or smaller than one depending on subjective preferences for income redistribution. The optimal second-best corrective tax is then either higher or lower than the Pigouvian level. The findings in this paper generalize and amend prior results based on representative-agent models, shedding new light on the weak double-dividend hypothesis, and on the welfare gains of recycling revenue from environmental taxes.},

GW of marine (wave and tidal) energy capacity between 2010 and 2020 in the Pentland Firth and Orkney Waters area (off the north coast of Scotland) with construction costs estimated at ??6 billion. This paper uses multi-sectoral economic models to explore the impact that these (temporary) expenditures could have on the Scottish economy. It is shown that the standard Input-Output (IO) modelling approach significantly overstates the employment and value added impacts compared to Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) methods-in which short-run scarcity of factors of production are explicitly modelled. CGE results (under myopic and forward-looking model specifications) produce smaller impacts during the timespan of expenditures but, unlike IO methods, identify non-trivial "legacy effects" after the expenditures cease. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The advantages and disadvantages of input-output methods and analysis methods are discussed as well as the issues surrounding the measurement of job creation.

However, most studies carried out in the past have focused on specific countries and those with a European-wide scope have not provided disaggregated results per country. Furthermore, differences between importing and exporting countries have not been considered. This paper aims to cover those gaps. It presents a novel methodology which integrates the aforementioned considerations in order to calculate the employment effects of renewable energy deployment. The methodology is useful to calculate dynamic employment factors (considering technology learning effects) and the specific capacity (based on trade effects) to which these factors should be applied. It is applied to three renewable energy technologies - photovoltaics, wind on-shore and wind off-shore- in the European Union Member States in the 2008-2012 period. The results using this novel methodology broadly confirm the figures provided in other contributions in the literature. The proposed methodology can be instrumental in assessing the socio-economic effects of policies and investment programmes targeting the deployment of renewable energy technologies.},

abstract = {Long run economic growth goes along with structural change. Recent work has identified explanatory factors on the demand side (non-homothetic preferences) and on the supply-side, in particular differential productivity growth across sectors and differences in factor proportions and capital deepening. This paper documents that there have also been differential trends in labor and capital income shares across sectors in the U.S. and in a broad set of other industrialized economies, and shows that a model where the degree of capital-labor substitutability differs across sectors is consistent with these trends. The interplay of differences in productivity growth and in the substitution elasticity across sectors drive both the evolution of sectoral factor income shares and the shape of structural change. We evaluate the empirical importance of this mechanism and the other mechanisms proposed in the literature in the context of the recent U.S. experience. We find that differences in productivity growth rates between manufacturing and services have been the most important driver of structural change. Yet, differences in substitution elasticities are key not only for understanding the evolution of sectoral and aggregate factor income shares, but also for the shape of structural change. Differences in capital intensity and non-homothetic preferences have hardly mattered for the manufacturing-services transition.},

@article{Bovenberg1994,
abstract = {Environmental and tax policies and the optimal provision of clean and dirty public goods are analysed within the context of a second-best framework of optimal taxation. Households consume both clean and dirty commodities. Degradation of the natural environment occurs due to the consumption of dirty private and public goods, but can be offset when the government engages in abatement activities. Increased environmental concern implies a higher dirt tax, a lower tax on labour, less employment, more public abatement, and a cleaner environment. If the elasticity of substitution between private consumption commodities and leisure is large and that between clean and dirty goods is small, public consumption may expand while private consumption contracts. Otherwise, public consumption falls.},

@article{Auerbach1985,
abstract = {The theory of excess burden and optimal commodity taxation is one of the oldest subjects of study in public finance, dating back to Dupuit (1844), and yet is also closely associated with the rapid analytical development of the field which commenced in the early 1970s. This chapter presents the chronological development of the concept of excess burden and the related study of optimal tax theory. A main objective is to uncover the interrelationships among various apparently distinct results, so as to bring out the basic structure of the entire problem. The various measures of excess burden, focusing on issues of approximation, informational requirements and aggregation over individuals, and the effects of a more general technology than the commonly supposed one with fixed producer prices are developed. Some of the empirical attempts to estimate various deadweight losses are reviewed. The issue of tax reform, as distinct from de novo tax design.},

Les imperfections de concurrence ainsi que l'existence de ch{\^{o}}mage involontaire rendent plus probable l'occurrence d'un double dividende au sens fort, de m{\^{e}}me que la prise en compte du r{\^{o}}le de la qualit{\'{e}} de l'environnement dans les comportements des m{\'{e}}nages ou dans la structure productive. [eng] One speaks about double dividend when the revenue neutral substitution of environmental taxes for other taxes leads to both an environmental benefit and an economic one. The first theoretical studies of this question, in a general equilibrium framework, argue that there is no secondary benefit in the sense of a reduction in tax distorsions. However, there are cases in which positive welfare gains can be obtained : when the environmental tax reform involves a tax shirting from labor to other factors or when there are feedbacks effects from environmental quality to the economic system. When studying this issue under the assumptions of imperfect competition and non clearing labour market, the occurrence of a double dividend becomes more likely.},
